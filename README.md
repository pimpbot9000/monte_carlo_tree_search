# 4 in a Row - The Game AI

## Motivation
Last Christmas my sister's 9 yo daughter beat me in 4 in a Row game multiple times.
To find some spiritual redeption I had to code an AI to beat the game (or help me to beat it).

## Minimax to the rescue
Initially I built the AI based on minimax algorithm. Essentially this being a brute force method it was very slow - even with alpha-beta pruning. 
Algorithm was so slow that with reasonable search time used the algorithm could "see" only ~10 moves ahead. Who would have guessed!
